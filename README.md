Snake game using Reinforcement Learning (RL)

This is the README.md file in my first Github repository

LIBRARIES USED:
virtualenv
numpy
tensorflow

ABOUT:
The simple snake game that we all know and love will now be controlled by a machine. 
Using RL, the snake will wiggle its way to victory by covering all of the squares (grid blocks).

TWO METHODS:
RL - The standard RL that makes the snake to many simulations of the game until it optimises its reward and wins
IRL - Using data gathered from "experts" to train the snake to win the game

COMPLETED:
The basics of the snake game is done.

FUTURE PLANS:
Need to implement a victory screen.
Create an executable file (with GUI)
Implement the RL using TensorFlow
